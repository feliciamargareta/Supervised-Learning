Customer Churn Prediction with KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)
- Split the train and test data to be able to evaluate the model accuracy
- Apply the KNN Prediction 
- Calculate the accuracy of train and test data
- Plot the Model Complexity Curve to find the optimal neighbors
- Predict the churn with the optimal neighbors
- Try improving the accuracy by applying feature scaling
- Compare the model accuracy before and after feature scaling
- Choose the best model by avoiding the overfitting and underfitting
